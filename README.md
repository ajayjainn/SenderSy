# SenderSy

SenderSy is a social site that allows people to send you anonymous messages. Upon sign-up you a get your private link. Send it to your friends to let them drop some messages for you. You won't find out their identity which makes it so much fun.

HTML-CSS along with Bootstrap framework is used on the frontend while Django is used on the backend.

# Getting Started

First clone the repository from Github and switch to the new directory:

    $ git clone git@github.com:ajayjainn/study-box.git
    $ cd study-box
    
Activate the virtualenv for your project.

If you don't have django installed for python 3 then run:

    $ pip3 install django
    
Install project dependencies:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    
Then simply apply the migrations:

    $ python manage.py migrate
    

You can now run the development server:

    $ python manage.py runserver

Once the server is hosted, head over to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ for the App.

Cheers and Happy Coding :)
